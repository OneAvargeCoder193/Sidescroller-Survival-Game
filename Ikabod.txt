Survival games need something the player has to adapt to.

Ideas for things the player will need to adapt to:
- Events (raids, natural disasters)
- Night time (enemies come out at night)
- Seasons (Winter time makes food scarce and water freeze, and may also bring new enemies)
- Guy comes like every week to collect stuff

Ideas I'm not so sure about:
- Disease (player randomly contracts diseases and will have to adapt to them before they pass. These can range from hunger drain or sneezing.)
- Other players


We could have infinite terrain, or we could have the game take place on many seperate islands... or just one big landmass.
Advantage of seperate islands is that it would allow us to give them unique properties, almost like a dimension. There could be a magic island or something.
